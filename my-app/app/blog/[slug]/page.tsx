    <p>Castor oil has been used for centuries as a natural remedy for various ailments, including hair loss and thinning. At Milele, we've incorporated this powerful oil into many of our treatments due to its numerous benefits for hair health.</p>
    
    <h2>How Castor Oil Promotes Hair Growth</h2>
    <p>Castor oil is rich in ricinoleic acid, a fatty acid that penetrates the scalp and hair follicles, providing the following benefits:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>Improves blood circulation to the scalp</li>
    <li>Balances scalp pH and can help resolve scalp infections</li>
    <li>Nourishes the scalp and strengthens the roots</li>
    <li>Adds volume and shine to the hair</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Use Castor Oil for Hair Growth</h2>
    <p>For best results, we recommend the following method:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Mix castor oil with a carrier oil like coconut or jojoba oil</li>
    <li>Massage the mixture into your scalp</li>
    <li>Leave it on for at least 30 minutes or overnight</li>
    <li>Wash thoroughly with a mild shampoo</li>
    </ol>
